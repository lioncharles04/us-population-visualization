# U.S. Population Growth Dashboard

This project is a simple Python-backed data visualization built using the Preswald platform. It demonstrates how to build an interactive web app that loads CSV data, renders UI elements, and generates a Plotly chart — all with a low-code approach.

## 📊 What It Does

- Loads a CSV dataset containing U.S. population figures from 2018 to 2022
- Displays a table of raw population and growth rate data
- Generates a line chart showing population growth over time
- Provides custom UI elements with markdown headings and descriptions

## 📁 Dataset Overview

| year | population   | growth_rate |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 2018 | 320000000    | 0.75        |
| 2019 | 325000000    | 1.56        |
| 2020 | 331000000    | 1.85        |
| 2021 | 333000000    | 0.60        |
| 2022 | 335000000    | 0.45        |
